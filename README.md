# Sport Simulator

Sport Simulator is a work-in-progress Node.js website. 
The plan is to implement full league simulation for Baseball, Basketball, and Football.
Each simulation will have multiple modes, such as:
  - Exhibition mode to pit two real-life teams from any year against one another
  - League mode using real-life team and player data
  - League mode using randomly generated teams and players
